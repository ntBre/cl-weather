* Dependencies
  - [[https://edicl.github.io/drakma][Drakma for HTTP requests]]

* TODOs
  - process XML into something usable, extract the useful parts
  - plot the hourly temperature data therein
  - add more data sources for more aspects of the weather
  - actually build the dashboard, probably using [[https://rabbibotton.github.io/clog/clog-manual.html][CLOG]]
