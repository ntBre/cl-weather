* Dependencies
** Common Lisp Libraries
   - [[https://edicl.github.io/drakma][Drakma for HTTP requests]]
   - [[https://common-lisp.net/project/xmls/README.html][XMLS for XML processing]]
   - [[https://edicl.github.io/flexi-streams/][FLEXI-STREAMS]] for converting octets to string
     - this came with XMLS
     - XMLS has an xmls/octets subpackage, but it operates on a stream
       instead of on a list of octets returned by Drakma
   - [[https://edicl.github.io/cl-ppcre][CL-PPCRE]] for regular expressions/string manipulation
** External programs
   - [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][gnuplot]] for plotting

* TODOs
  - [X] process XML into something usable, extract the useful parts
  - [X] plot the hourly temperature data therein
  - [ ] add more data sources for more aspects of the weather
    - really extract more data from the XML
  - [ ] actually build the dashboard, probably using [[https://rabbibotton.github.io/clog/clog-manual.html][CLOG]]
    - also considering just producing a nice picture summarizing the
      day's weather
